## Assignments

### Introduction

Programming assignments are part of the [assessment](assessment.md). Some general rules: 
- If the assignment does not specify (enough) milestones create your own. Document them in the README.
- Your repo must show a trail of your work. I will **not** grade your programs if your repo only shows the finished product without the work leading up to the intermediate milestones.
- All programs must be tested.
- No points for programs that do not run. If you have specific problems get in touch before the deadline.
- Grading will be based on correctness, but readability and maintanability will also be taken into consideration.

See also the info on [git best practices](git-best-practices.md). 

**Assignments** can be done in groups of up to 2 students. Writing a compiler is difficult. Assignments are not intended (only) as a test of your abilities, but are (also) part of the learning process. So do not hesitate to ask me questions in class, on the discussion forum, in office hourse, or directly via email. Note that [participation]() is part of the assessment. 

If you get stuck in one of the Assignments 2-5:
- Read my notes and the relevant sections of the book. If you have any questions on this, **ask on the discussion forum** as this may be of interest to everybody.
- Discuss with your team member. Try to implement the relevant case. Write your own test programs.
- If you remain stuck after putting in all this work, commit your code to the repo and send me an email.
