# BNFC and Java

The IPL book is written with Haskell and Java in mind. BNFC also supports other programming languages. For example

    bnfc -m -c  Calc.cf      # to generate C
    bnfc -m -cpp Calc.cf      # to generate C++
    bnfc -m -java Calc.cf      # to generate Java
    bnfc -m -haskell Calc.cf      # to generate Haskell
    
should all work. But to make the Java lexer and parser some more installation work is needed.

I will assume that you successfully followed [my BNFC installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md). Here we will look at how to get the 
Java part of the [BNFC tutorial](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/tutorial/bnfc-tutorial.html) to work.

First, we need to install the latest version of the Java lexer JLex and parser generator Cup. It is necessary to change the CLASSPATH variable so that the java compiler knows the location of the JLex and Cup. In my case I created directories `/usr/local/java`and `/usr/local/java/Cup`and `/usr/local/java/JLex` and then [added to my `.bash_profile`](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2020/blob/master/PATH.md)

     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:.:/usr/local/java/:/usr/local/java/Cup:/usr/local/java/JLex
     
(Make sure to respect the distinction between capitalised and non-capitalised letters as in "JLex" vs "jlex". Don't miss out the `:.:`.)

Install [JLex](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/) version 1.2.6 (the latest version). To quote from the BNFC tutorial "JLex is just one Java file. Put it in some directory, e.g. `/usr/local/java/JLex`. Compile it with 

    sudo javac Main.java 
    
in that directory". You may also want to look at the instructions in the [readme file](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/current/README). After compiling `Main.java` my directory `/usr/local/java/JLex` contains (do an `ls` in `/usr/local/java/JLex`)

            CAccept.class            CLexGen.class            CUtility.class
            CAcceptAnchor.class      CMakeNfa.class           Main.class
            CAlloc.class             CMinimize.class          Main.java
            CBunch.class             CNfa.class               SparseBitSet$1.class
            CDTrans.class            CNfa2Dfa.class           SparseBitSet$2.class
            CDfa.class               CNfaPair.class           SparseBitSet$3.class
            CEmit.class              CSet.class               SparseBitSet$4.class
            CError.class             CSimplifyNfa.class       SparseBitSet$BinOp.class
            CInput.class             CSpec.class              SparseBitSet.class

You can check the value of `CLASSPATH` by typing `echo $CLASSPATH`. Make sure that the directory in which you compiled `javac Main.java` is in the CLASSPATH.

Install the latest version of [Cup](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/), the Java parser generator. In my case, I put `java-cup-11b.jar` into `/usr/local/java/Cup` and then unzipped it using 

    sudo unzip java-cup-11b.jar
    
(`sudo` is only needed if you work in a directory such as `/usr/local/` that needs administrator's rights; you could install the files in your home directory instead.)

(If you are installing in the Linux subsystem of Windows you might need to do a `sudo apt-get install unzip` to install `unzip`.)

Now, going back to the directory `examples` in the directory `bnfc` downloaded from github, execute

    bnfc -m -java Calc.cf
    make
 
should result in producing a bunch of `.java` files as described on page 12 of the [slides](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/slides/2-slides-ipl-book.pdf).

To test whether the parser works enter (still working in the directory `bnfc/examples')

    echo "23 + 4 * 70" | java Calc/Test 
        
which should give you 

            Parse Succesful!
            [Abstract Syntax]
            (EAdd (EInt 23) (EMul (EInt 4) (EInt 70))) 
            [Linearized Tree]
            23 + 4 * 70
