**Acknowledgements:**

This course was developed for the students at Chapman University by myself and Samuel Balco. 

I am grateful that most of what I wanted to cover had already been developed by Aarne Ranta, whose book "Implementing Programming Languages" is the main reference for this course and whose assignments form its core. I am also very grateful to Andreas Abel who took over teaching Ranta's course at Chalmers and who answered a number of my questions. 

As always, I am grateful to my colleagues from whom I learned myself. Regular discussions with Peter Jipsen and Drew Moshier keep influencting the content and style of the course.

These should probably go somewhere else, but I collect them here for now.
