**Acknowledgements:**

This course was developed for the students at Chapman University by myself and Samuel Balco. 

I am grateful that most of what I wanted to cover had already been developed by Aarne Ranta, whose book "Implementing Programming Languages" is the main reference for this course and whose assignments form its core. I am also very grateful to Andreas Abel who took over teaching Ranta's course at Chalmers and who answered a number of my questions. 

As always, I am grateful to my colleagues from whom I learned myself. Regular discussions with Peter Jipsen and Drew Moshier keep influencting the content and style of the course.

**Various Links**:

These should probably go somewhere else, but I collect them here for now. (Thanks to Matt Raymond for always having a new surprising link to contribute.)

- A [Finite State Machine Editor](https://stonecypher.github.io/jssm-viz-demo/graph_explorer.html), found via [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26578540).

- Excellent article on history and implementation of [regexp search](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html).

- The [obfuscated tiny c compiler](https://bellard.org/otcc/otcc.c) has only 2048 bytes.

- [Regexp-based address validation](http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html). We introduced automata as a specification language for search algorithms and regexps as a specification language for automata. This article highlights the use of Perl as a specification language for regexps. This building of languages on top of other languages is typical for software engineering.

- [Parsing HTML with Regexps?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10282121) Read this thread to self-test your knowledge of lexing and parsing (and learn a few new things on the way). 

- [A Modern Compiler for the French Tax Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07966.pdf). A great example of the impact of modern compiler techniques: "We have been formally approved to start replacing the legacy infrastructure with our new implementation, meaning that within a few yearsâ€™ time, all French tax returns will be processed using the compiler described in the present paper."
